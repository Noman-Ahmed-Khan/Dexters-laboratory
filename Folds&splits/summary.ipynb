    "- **Basic CV methods:** `KFold`, `ShuffleSplit`, and `TimeSeriesSplit` are suitable when you have no grouping or stratification constraints.\n",
    "- **Stratified methods:** `StratifiedKFold` and `StratifiedShuffleSplit` ensure class balance in splits for classification tasks.\n",
    "- **Group-aware methods:** `GroupKFold`, `LeaveOneGroupOut`, and `StratifiedGroupKFold` (if available) prevent data leakage when samples belong to groups.\n",
    "- **Exhaustive methods:** `LeaveOneOut` and `LeavePOut` generate many splits and are best used with small datasets.\n",
    "- **Predefined splits:** `PredefinedSplit` is used when you have an external split definition.\n",
    "- **Repeated methods:** `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` average performance over multiple random splits.\n",

    "Each of these strategies has its own use case and trade-offs regarding bias, variance, and computational cost. Choosing the right one depends on your datasetâ€™s characteristics and the nature of your task."
